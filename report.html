        <h3>1. List of Issues and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
            While working on this project, I faced several challenges, especially because I was using a mobile phone instead of a computer. Writing HTML code and organizing the folder structure through a phone made things slower and more complicated. 
            Additionally, uploading files to GitHub and editing them online required a lot of patience and effort. Sometimes the GitHub interface didn’t work smoothly on mobile.
            <br><br>
            To solve these issues, I used the GitHub mobile site and planned everything in advance. I also used simple and clean code to make editing easier. Breaking down the work into small parts helped me stay organized and focused.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Honest Opinion</h3>
        <p>
            Overall, the project was challenging but also a great learning experience. I enjoyed building a visual representation using flowcharts and improving my HTML skills.
            Doing everything from a phone was not easy, but I feel proud that I managed to complete it. If I had access to a computer, I believe I could’ve added more features and improved the design even more.
            <br><br>
            In the end, I am satisfied with the result and glad I pushed through the difficulties.
